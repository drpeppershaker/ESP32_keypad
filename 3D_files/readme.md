## 3D Files

- ESP32\_keypad\_short_bottom.stl - Mount the esp32 'upside-down' and screw in with the tiniest screws you can find.
- ESP32\_keypad\_tall\_bottom.stl - Taller version which should allow a _bit_ more rooom for wires/soldering
- ESP32\_Macropad\_top.stl - Top where you mount the key switches. There are groves on the bottom to help with wiring the common GND wire.

NOTE: You can absolutely use the LED version without LEDs inside of it.
